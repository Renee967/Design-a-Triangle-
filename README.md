# Design-a-Triangle-

Define an enumeration type, named triangleType, that has the values scalene, isosceles, equilateral, and noTriangle. (20 points)
Write a function, triangleShape, that takes as parameters three numbers, each of which represents the length of a side of the triangle. The function should return the shape of the triangle (enum or int). (Note: In a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side) (30 points)
In the main() function prompts the user to input the length of the sides of the triangle and outputs the shape of the triangle. (20 points)
In the main function, use returned value from the triangleShape function in the switch statement to display the type of a triangle to the user (30 points)
Ex1: If the input is: 4 5 6
Output:  Your triangle is: scalene
Ex2: If the input is: 10 5 50
Output:  This is not a triangle
